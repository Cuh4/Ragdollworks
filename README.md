# üìö Ragdollworks
A Roblox 2D sandbox featuring spawnable objects in various sandbox maps, wiring, simulated humans, physics, machinery, explosions, and more.

In other words, a cheap ripoff of People Playground.

## ‚ùî | What's "Rage"?
Rage is the foundation of this game. It serves as a "bootloader" by allowing the creation of services and loading them based on a manually-set (and automatically) priority order. Since it serves as a bootloader, it also allows for using single-script architecture.

Rage will eventually get its own repo and will be fully open-sourced.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Setup
### Prerequisites
1) [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman)
2) (Optional) [Roblox LSP Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nightrains.robloxlsp). I do not use the successor Luau extension because I've ran into too many quirks using it on this project.

### Steps
1) `git clone` this repo.
2) `cd` into the repo folder.
3) Install all tools via `aftman install`. This will install all tools used in this game like Wally and Rojo.
4) Run `wally install`. This will install all Wally packages used in this game.
5) Run `rojo serve`. This will allow you to synchronise code from the repo to the game itself in Roblox Studio.
6) [Ask me personally](https://discord.com/users/1141077132915777616) for the game's Roblox place file. It is not publicly available to prevent copycat games.
7) Open it up in Roblox Studio.
8) Install the `Rojo` plugin in Roblox Studio.
9) Open up `Rojo` in Roblox Studio and click "Connect". Code should now sync from the repo directory to the game allowing you to code in VSCode.

## ü§¨ | Rants
- Luau LSP is the most up-to-date LSP for Roblox, but I can't use it because it can't infer types through references (e.g: `require(Rage.Path.ID)` is an unknown type). Stuck with Roblox LSP that can do this but is outdated and most packages don't support types for it. Fuck
- Roblox LSP: Given two files `foo.luau` and `bar.luau`, if `foo` requires `bar`, and another file called `main.luau` requires `foo` and `bar`, the types in `bar` will get all fucked and can't be used in `main.luau`. The LSP knows its there and even shows that, but it will not provide things like auto-completion when indexing a table of the type. Fuck
